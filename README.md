# ColorMyWorld

ColorMyWorld was a project worked on by myself and 5 others for a course in my final year of university. The original was built natively for Android using Android Studio. This is my recreation of the project in native iOS for the sake of practicing Swift.

ColorMyWorld is an app designed to help colorblind people and designers concerned about how colorblind people interact with their designs. The app comes with a few core points of functionality:
* Users can upload photos or take pictures
* Users can click on the picture and see what colour they clicked on
* Users can change the saturation or brightness of the image
* Users can apply colorblind filters to simulate how colorblind people view the image
